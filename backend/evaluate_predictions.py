    """Score the activity predictions against the ground truth.

    Metrics are calculated for bootstrapped samples of the dataset to allow for testing
    the statistical significance of differences between submissions. Each endpoint is
    scored with the metric list appropriate to its type — regression endpoints get
    ``ACTIVITY_METRICS``, classification endpoints get ``CLASSIFICATION_METRICS``
    — see ``_metrics_for_endpoint``.

    Each endpoint is scored only on the compounds that have a ground-truth value for
    that endpoint — a compound not tested for a given endpoint has ``y_true == NaN``
    there and is excluded from that endpoint's bootstrap sampling entirely. Every
    compound with a ground-truth value is expected to have a prediction (participants
    are asked to predict every compound, and submission_validation.py is the primary
    check for missing predictions); a NaN prediction for such a compound is treated as
    a validation failure here too.

    Regression endpoints carry credible-interval bound columns in ``ground_truth``
    (named ``f"{endpoint}{REGRESSION_CREDIBLE_INTERVALS_UPPER_SUFFIX}"`` /
    ``f"{endpoint}{REGRESSION_CREDIBLE_INTERVALS_LOWER_SUFFIX}"``), used by the
    soft-thresholded RAE metric (``ST-RAE``). When present, these are threaded through
    to ``bootstrap_metrics`` alongside ``y_true``/``y_pred``; classification endpoints
    have no such columns, so ``None`` is passed instead (harmless, since none of
    ``CLASSIFICATION_METRICS`` consume them).

    This function does not compute the macro-averaged "MA" pseudo-endpoint. Callers
    that want a track's "MA" row should call ``add_macro_endpoint`` on this function's
    output with the same ``endpoints`` (and that track's own metrics).

    Args:
        predictions (pd.DataFrame): The predicted activity values.
        ground_truth (pd.DataFrame): The true activity values.
        endpoints (list[str]): The endpoints to score, e.g. ``REGRESSION_ENDPOINTS``
            or ``CLASSIFICATION_ENDPOINTS`` — regression and classification are
            independent submission tracks, so a given call only ever scores one
            track's endpoints.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the scored bootstrapped activity

    For every bootstrap sample, every metric in ``metrics`` is macro-averaged across

    Spearman_R was previously averaged via a Fisher z-transform (``arctanh`` /
    ``tanh``), the standard variance-stabilising treatment for combining several
    noisy *estimates of the same underlying correlation* (e.g. meta-analysis, or
    averaging one endpoint's Spearman across repeated resamples of the same data).
    That doesn't apply here: this average combines Spearman scores from *different*
    endpoints, which are unrelated true correlations, not repeated estimates of one. Fisher's z blows up near +/-1 (``arctanh(1) = inf``,
    clipped in practice but still huge — e.g. ``arctanh(1 - 1e-7) ≈ 8.4`` vs.
    ``arctanh(0) = 0``), so a submission with a near-perfect Spearman on a couple of
    endpoints and ~0 on the rest could macro-average to ~0.99 instead of the
    naively-expected ~0.5, letting a handful of easy/lucky endpoints dominate the
    macro score. A plain mean — already used for ST-RAE/MAE/R2/Kendall_Tau — doesn't have
    this failure mode, so Spearman_R now uses one too, for the same reason
    Kendall_Tau always has: Fisher's z-transform has no standard extension to
    Kendall's tau (different asymptotic sampling distribution), so there was never a

    are recovered from ``smiles`` when provided (RDKit's PDB parser leaves every
    bond single, which breaks geometry and energy checks). ``mol_cond`` is the
    protein from the *predicted* complex so the ligand and receptor are in the
    same coordinate frame. If the number of failed PoseBusters checks exceeds
    ``max_pb_failures``, all three metric scores are overridden with worst-case
    values (LDDT-PLI=0, LDDT-LP=0, BiSyRMSD=``BISYRMSD_NAN_PENALTY``).
    Returns NaN for every metric if scoring fails for any reason, so that a
    single bad submission file does not abort the full evaluation.

    Args:
        model_path (str): Filesystem path to the predicted complex PDB file.
        ref_path (str): Filesystem path to the reference complex PDB file.
        max_pb_failures (int): Maximum number of PoseBusters checks the predicted
            ligand may fail before its scores are zeroed. Defaults to
            ``POSEBUSTERS_MAX_FAILURES``.
        smiles (str | None): Ground-truth SMILES for the ligand, used to assign
            correct bond orders before running PoseBusters. When ``None``, bond
            orders are left as parsed (all single), which may cause false failures
            on geometry and energy checks.

    Returns:
        tuple[dict[str, float], list[str]]: A pair of (scores, failed_pb_checks).
            ``scores`` maps metric name to value (keys: ``LDDT-PLI``, ``BiSyRMSD``,
            ``LDDT-LP``); any metric that cannot be computed is ``np.nan``.
            ``failed_pb_checks`` is the sorted list of PoseBusters check names that
            failed when the failure count exceeds ``max_pb_failures``; empty when the
            pose passes, when PoseBusters is skipped due to parse errors, or when
            scoring fails entirely.
